# Rock, Paper, Scissors Project
## Inspired by the Odin Project

A simple game of Rock, Paper, Scissors design to work in the web browser.
Used HTML, CSS, and Native Javascript.

### CSS
Experimented with Flex displays in CSS and utilizing the hover filter style to improve
how users interact with the page.


### JavaScript
Practiced querySelection, filtering through NodeLists, and altering the DOM to update
the game state.
